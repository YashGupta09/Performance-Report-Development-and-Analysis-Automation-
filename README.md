# Performance Report Development and Analysis Automation

I worked on this project during my internship at Kinai Infotech, Mumbai, India in 2016. I used newly learned skills of Python to automate the report devlopment and analysis procedure. It helped Software Testers save time and reduced their workload.

The project was coded in Python 2.7 and it consists of two files:

- Issue_Analyzer.py
  This program performs bug analysis and builds a pie chart based on the analysis.

- Issue_Analyzer2.py
  This program tracks the occurence of different types of bugs in various modules of the projects at Kinai Infotech.

These programs take special Excel documents developed by software testers at Kinai Infotech as input. I cannot upload those documents due to confidentiality clause.
